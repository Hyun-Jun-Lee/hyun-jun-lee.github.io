Starting my development career at an early-stage startup, I had the opportunity to gain experience beyond the role of a developer, venturing into diverse fields.

Through this experience, I've gained valuable insights not only in technical knowledge but also in project management and building systems for team collaboration.

Moreover, in this journey, I've deeply realized that the core competency of a developer extends beyond writing good codeâ€”it's about effectively solving complex problems and translating project requirements into technical solutions.

With these experiences as my foundation, my goal is to evolve as a developer with a strong understanding of business alongside my technical abilities.
